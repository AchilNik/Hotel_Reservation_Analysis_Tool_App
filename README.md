This project is a Python-based application that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for analyzing and visualizing hotel reservation data. The tool allows users to explore key statistics and 
trends regarding hotel reservations, such as average stay duration, cancellation rates, and seasonal booking patterns. It features an intuitive menu that guides users through different analysis 
options and displays the results in interactive charts.

Key Features:
1) Basic Statistics: Calculates average stay duration and cancellation rates for each hotel.
2) Monthly and Seasonal Distribution: Displays the distribution of reservations by month and season.
3) Room Type Analysis: Shows reservation breakdowns by room type.
4) Guest Demographics: Analyzes reservations for families, couples, and solo travelers.
5) Reservation Trends: Visualizes booking trends over time to identify patterns and peaks.
6) Seasonality and Cancellations: Examines seasonal trends in bookings and cancellations.


The results are saved in a MySQL or SQLite database and can be exported to .csv files for further analysis or reporting. This project combines Python programming with data visualization libraries 
(such as Matplotlib or Plotly) to offer an in-depth view of hotel booking behaviors.
